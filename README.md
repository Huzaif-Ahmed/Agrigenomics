# Agrigenomics Project README

## Project Overview

The Agrigenomics project is a research initiative focused on the development of a predictive model for understanding gene sequences and predicting the phenotypic characteristics, specifically the height, of rice cultivars. By analyzing the genetic makeup of rice plants, this project aims to enhance our understanding of the relationship between genes and traits, contributing to advancements in agriculture and crop breeding.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of the Agrigenomics project is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the height of rice cultivars based on their gene sequences. This predictive capability will enable researchers and agricultural practitioners to identify desirable traits more efficiently, leading to improved crop yields and resilience.

## Key Features

- Gene sequence analysis: The project involves the analysis of gene sequences of rice cultivars to identify key genetic markers associated with plant height.
- Predictive modeling: Utilizing machine learning and statistical techniques, the project aims to develop a predictive model that can correlate gene sequences with phenotypic characteristics.
- Data analysis tools: The project includes the development of tools and algorithms for processing and analyzing large-scale genomic data sets to extract meaningful insights.
